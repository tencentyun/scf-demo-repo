        :param max_retries: How many times to attempt to produce a given batch of
            messages before raising an error. Allowing retries will potentially change
            the ordering of records because if two records are sent to a single partition,
            and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the second
            record may appear first. If you want to completely disallow message
            reordering, use `sync=True`.
        :type max_retries: int
        :param retry_backoff_ms: The amount of time (in milliseconds) to
            back off during produce request retries. This does not equal the total time
            spent between message send attempts, since that number can be influenced
            by other kwargs, including `linger_ms` and `socket_timeout_ms`.
        :type retry_backoff_ms: int
        :param required_acks: The number of other brokers that must have
            committed the data to their log and acknowledged this to the leader
            before a request is considered complete
        :type required_acks: int
        :param ack_timeout_ms: The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for
            acknowledgment of a produce request on the server.
        :type ack_timeout_ms: int
        :param max_queued_messages: The maximum number of messages the producer
            can have waiting to be sent to the broker. If messages are sent
            faster than they can be delivered to the broker, the producer will
            either block or throw an exception based on the preference specified
            with block_on_queue_full.
        :type max_queued_messages: int
        :param min_queued_messages: The minimum number of messages the producer
            can have waiting in a queue before it flushes that queue to its
            broker (must be greater than 0). This paramater can be used to
            control the number of messages sent in one batch during async
            production. This parameter is automatically overridden to 1
            when `sync=True`.
        :type min_queued_messages: int
        :param linger_ms: This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for
            batching: once the producer gets min_queued_messages worth of
            messages for a broker, it will be sent immediately regardless of
            this setting.  However, if we have fewer than this many messages
            accumulated for this partition we will 'linger' for the specified
            time waiting for more records to show up. linger_ms=0 indicates no
            lingering - messages are sent as fast as possible after they are
            `produce()`d.
        :type linger_ms: int
        :param queue_empty_timeout_ms: The amount of time in milliseconds for which
            the producer's worker threads should block when no messages are available
            to flush to brokers. After each `linger_ms` interval, the worker thread
            checks for the presence of at least one message in its queue. If there is
            not at least one, it enters an "empty wait" period for
            `queue_empty_timeout_ms` before starting a new `linger_ms` wait loop. If
            `queue_empty_timeout_ms` is 0, this "empty wait" period is a noop, and
            flushes will continue to be attempted at intervals of `linger_ms`, even
            when the queue is empty. If `queue_empty_timeout_ms` is a positive integer,
            this "empty wait" period will last for at most that long, but it ends earlier
            if a message is `produce()`d before that time. If `queue_empty_timeout_ms` is
            -1, the "empty wait" period can only be stopped (and the worker thread killed)
            by a call to either `produce()` or `stop()` - it will never time out.
        :type queue_empty_timeout_ms: int
        :param block_on_queue_full: When the producer's message queue for a
            broker contains max_queued_messages, we must either stop accepting
            new messages (block) or throw an error. If True, this setting
            indicates we should block until space is available in the queue.
            If False, we should throw an error immediately.
        :type block_on_queue_full: bool
        :param max_request_size:
            The maximum size of a request in bytes. This is also effectively a
            cap on the maximum record size. Note that the server has its own
            cap on record size which may be different from this. This setting
            will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a
            single request to avoid sending huge requests.
        :type max_request_size: int
        :param sync: Whether calls to `produce` should wait for the message to
            send before returning.  If `True`, an exception will be raised from
            `produce()` if delivery to kafka failed.
        :type sync: bool
        :param delivery_reports: If set to `True`, the producer will maintain a
            thread-local queue on which delivery reports are posted for each
            message produced.  These must regularly be retrieved through
            `get_delivery_report()`, which returns a 2-tuple of
            :class:`pykafka.protocol.Message` and either `None` (for success)
            or an `Exception` in case of failed delivery to kafka. If
            `get_delivery_report()` is not called regularly with this setting enabled,
            memory usage will grow unbounded. This setting is ignored when `sync=True`.
        :type delivery_reports: bool
        :param pending_timeout_ms: The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for
            delivery reports to be returned from the broker during a `produce()` call.
            Also, the time in ms to wait during a `stop()` call for all messages to be
            marked as delivered. -1 indicates that these calls should block indefinitely.
            Differs from `ack_timeout_ms` in that `ack_timeout_ms` is a value sent to the
            broker to control the broker-side timeout, while `pending_timeout_ms` is used
            internally by pykafka and not sent to the broker.
        :type pending_timeout_ms:
        :param auto_start: Whether the producer should begin communicating
            with kafka after __init__ is complete. If false, communication
            can be started with `start()`.
        :type auto_start: bool
        :param serializer: A function defining how to serialize messages to be sent
            to Kafka. A function with the signature d(value, partition_key) that
            returns a tuple of (serialized_value, serialized_partition_key). The
            arguments passed to this function are a message's value and partition key,
            and the returned data should be these fields transformed according to the
            client code's serialization logic.  See `pykafka.utils.__init__` for stock
            implemtations.
